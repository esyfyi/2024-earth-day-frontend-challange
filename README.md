_This is a submission for [Frontend Challenge v24.04.17](https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-for-the-next-frontend-challenge-earth-day-edition-52e4), Glam Up My Markup: Earth Day Celebration Landing Page_

## What I Built

My main goal was to create an unusual aesthetic. Neo-brutalism, Y2k, and a little bit of Furiger Aero inspired me. I tried to mix and match styles and elements until I found something that I believe is visually appealing.
I mainly used CSS and a little bit of JS. I had to sacrifice a lot of readability, but I think it was worth it.

I hope you like it as well!

## Journey

My process was simple: I went online, looked for inspiration, tried to recreate them, and then mixed and matched until I found something I liked. I also used a lot of clip-paths and CSS filters; I like how the contrasting text interacts with the background illustration.

I used Adobe Firefly to generate the background illustration, and then I separated it into multiple layers using Photoshop.

I had to use requestAnimationFrame to smooth the scrolling animations, as using only the scroll events felt choppy.

Overall, I'm happy with the result, and it was a fun couple of hours.
